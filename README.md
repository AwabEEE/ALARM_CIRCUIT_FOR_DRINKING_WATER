# ALARM_CIRCUIT_FOR_DRINKING_WATER
This project is an AutoCAD-drawn schematic of a water level alarm circuit. It was created to practice technical drawing skills in AutoCAD and understand how water level sensors interact with electronics. The circuit is based on a 555 Timer IC (LM555), which triggers an alarm when water reaches a certain level.
